-- What was the issue in circle.cpp and how did you fix it?
The issue I found with circle.cpp was that the calculations for
diameter, area, and circumference were not actually being calculated;
instead, it was printing the radius every time. To fix this, I did
the necessary math operations to actually compute the diameter,
area, and circumference.

-- What was the issue in hello.cpp and how did you fix it?
The issue I found with hello.cpp was that it was not actually
printing the inputted name. It was instead printing an empty string
for some reason. I fixed this by simply replacing the empty string
with the name variable, which was defined as stdin.

-- What was the issue in numbername.cpp and how did you fix it?
The issue I found with numbername.ccp was that the names of the numbers
were not actually being handled and printed in the switch statement, but
instead printed empty strings every time. I fixed this by replacing the
empty string in the appropriate switch case with either name1, name2,
or name3.
